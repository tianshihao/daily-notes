# Daily Notes Extension

This is the README for the "Daily Notes" extension. This extension allows you to create a daily note with a single command.

## Features

The "Daily Notes" extension provides the following feature:

### Editing

- **Create Daily Note**: With a single command `daily-notes.openTodaysDailyNote`, you can create a new note for the current day. This note is named with today's date and opened in a new editor tab.

- **Insert Date/Time**: You can insert the current date and time into the note with `daily-notes.insertTimestamp`.

### Content Control

Before enable this feature, you need to set the `dailyNotes.enableGit` to `true`. The extension will detect the git repository in the workspace and use it to commit the changes. Make sure the git repository is initialized and connected to a remote repository.

- **Commit**: You can commit the changes to the git repository with `daily-notes.commit`.

- **Sync with Remote**: You can push the changes to the remote repository with `daily-notes.sync`.

- **Auto Commit**: Set `dailyNotes.autoCommit` to `true`. then the extension will automatically commit the changes every `dailyNotes.autoCommitInterval` mintues to the git repository.
